- 👋 Hi, I’m @seajaysee
- 👀 I’m interested in learning code and software development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a bit of Python as part of a software dev apprenticeship.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any basic projects to help me learn.
- 📫 How to reach me ... not sure yet - I need to read the github guide!
